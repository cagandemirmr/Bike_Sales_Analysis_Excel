## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in Excel, including organizing datasets, creating pivot tables, graphics, and dashboards.

## Data Organization

1. **Marital Status**: Changed the values to a more readable format:
   - "M" changed to "Married"
   - "S" changed to "Single"
2. **Gender**: Made some changes to the Gender column.
3. **Income**: Changed the data type to currency and reduced the number of decimals for better readability.


## Create Age Brackets using IF

Used nested IF statements to define age categories for easier visualization. Note that "EÄžER" is used instead of "IF" as this project was done using the Turkish version of Excel.

- If Age < 31: "Adolescence"
- If Age >= 31 and Age <= 55: "Middle Aged"
- If Age > 55: "Old"

Created pivot tables based on the working sheet with the following analyses:

No special filters or sorting techniques were applied.
